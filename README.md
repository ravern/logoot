# Logoot on Go
This is an implementation of the Logoot CRDT in Go. Worked on this project to learn Go and also collaborative text editing. The Logoot CRDT has been implemented properly, but the demo was hacked together over the course of a few hours. Do email me if you use this for a project of yours!

Do note that this is not production ready.

## Installation
```bash
$ go get github.com/ravernkoh/logoot/doc
```
